        <h2>Description of Project</h2>
        <span>I wrote assemby code in the MARIE Simulator to emulate a CPU and run assembly instructions to multiply multiple positive numbers and close early if negative numbers are input.</span>
        <h2>Skills Learned from Project</h2>
        <span>I learned the complexity of CPU instructions and how the CPU processes instruction sets and manages addresses and memory for running programs.</span>
